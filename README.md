# untitled-2d-platformer
A game worked on by me and a friend around 2 years ago. Made in gamemaker studio 2. My friend managed the design and spritework of the game, while I programmed it with some suggestive feedback and ideas from both of us. It turned out pretty well for a fun little side project.
